                <p> Harry Potter is a staple in my household I grew up reading the books. I would rate this movie a 10/10 overall movie. From the deep ties to family to the way the directors kept key aspects of the book.
                    Seeing my favorite book characters brough to life in such a way brings so much joy to me. I think the VFX artists also did an amazing job
                    with the magical beasts and blending them seamlessly into the movie. I also loved the casting choices because you could see the chemistry the cast
                    has with each other
