    <p>Hi my name is Tristen J Hum but my friends call me Tj. My name wasn't always Tj it used to be Bashir Bachar Masri; when I was adopted I changed my  first name and
    took my moms last name. <br> I was born in RI and have lived here my whole life. I have an obsession with comic books and magic Total nerd. I also believe true 
    magic does exist but hasn't been found. All magic is just science <br> undiscovered. I went to school in Woonsocket for all of high school. During high school 
    I wrestled for the high school team. I started in my sophmore year I broke my rib and ended my season early.<br>The next  year I took first place in JV states. My senior year
    I practiced with my sisters dad, who's an Junior Olympic Champion. That year I preformed my best placing 22nd in the state and <br>qualifying for states. Below is a picture taken 
    from my fastest pin.
